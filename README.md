# Bank-Customer-Term-Deposit-Prediction
### Problem Statement
This project seeks to analyze the  marketing campaign data of a bank to optimize its marketing campaigns to attract more customers to term deposit subscriptions.
### Objective
- Develop a Deep Learning model to predict the marketing campaign outcome, such as whether or not a bank customer will make a term deposit.
- Evaluate the model's performance using relevant evaluation metrics
##### Data Features: age, job, marital, education, default, balance,	housing, loan, contact,day,	month,	duration,	campaign,	pdays,	previous,	poutcome, and deposit.

##### The correlation matrix of the bank customer data, revealed the following:
- Age and Balance: weak positive correlation (0.106), indicating that older customers tend to have higher balances.
- Age and Loan: Weakly positively correlated (0.085), suggesting that older customers are slightly more likely to have loans.
- Balance and Campaign: Weakly negatively correlated (-0.039), indicating that customers with higher balances tend to respond less to campaigns.
- Contact and Pdays: Moderately positively correlated (0.460), suggesting that customers who are contacted more frequently tend to have more past due days.
- Deposit and Duration: Moderately positively correlated (0.441), indicating that longer-term deposits tend to have higher durations.
- Education and Housing: weakly positively correlated (0.137), suggesting that customers with higher education levels tend to have better housing situations.
- Job and Marital: Weakly positively correlated (0.102), indicating that customers with better job situations tend to be married.
- Pdays and Previous: Strongly positively correlated (0.969), suggesting that customers with more past due days tend to have
